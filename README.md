Welcome to our space shooter game's readme file!
This is a project made by students of Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal as a submission for a 2-day live Hackathon conducted by Zynga Games India. Our project is called "Meteor Shooter" and it is a 2d game made using Unity.

Game Aim: To shoot down as many meteors as you can while avoiding getting hit by them is the game's aim. In order to blast the meteors down, the player must manoeuvre their spaceship around the screen. 

Spaceship: The player has the option for choosing the style of the spaceship they want to use while they play the game.

Game controls: The spaceship can be moved about the screen by swiping across the scene. The spaceship's weapon will be fired when the firebutton is pressed, destroying any meteors in its route. 

Score: Points are awarded to the player for shooting down meteors. The size of the meteor affects how many points are awarded. More points are awarded for larger meteors than for smaller ones. If the player is struck by a meteor, they will also lose points and lives.

Power-ups: The player will have the chance to gather power-ups that will offer them an advantage as they go through the game. Multi-shoot abilities and shields that guard the spaceship from meteor strikes are some of these power-ups.

Levels:One level will be completed if the player is able to last the time limit without getting destroyed by all the meteors and still have health left.

Game Over: When a player loses all of their life, the game is over. Their score as well as the highest score so far will be shown at this point. The player might choose to play again and attempt to outperform their prior score.

We sincerely hope you have fun playing our space shooter!
